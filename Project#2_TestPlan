Test Plan: RESTful Booker API
Test Plan Identifier
TP-RESTBOOKER-API-001
Introduction
This test plan outlines the testing approach for the RESTful Booker API, a sample booking system with endpoints for user authentication, booking management (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and health checks.
Objectives
- Validate all endpoints respond with correct HTTP status codes and expected outputs.
- Ensure secure and correct behavior on protected routes.
- Verify CRUD operations on booking resources.
- Test edge cases and error handling.
Scope
In Scope:
- Authentication (/auth)
- Booking CRUD operations
- Health check (/ping)
Out of Scope:
- Integration with UI or external systems
Test Environment
- API Base URL: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com
- Protocol: HTTPS
- Tools: Postman / RestAssured / JMeter / Newman
- Authentication: Basic Auth / Token via Cookie header
Test Items
- /auth (POST)
- /booking (GET, POST)
- /booking/:id (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- /ping (GET)
Entry Criteria
- API server is available
- Tools like Postman are installed
- Auth credentials are known
Exit Criteria
- All critical test cases pass
- Bugs, if any, are logged and addressed
- Test report is reviewed and shared
Deliverables
- Test Plan
- Postman Collection or Test Scripts
- Test Execution Report
- Bug Log
Roles and Responsibilities
QA/Test Engineer: Design and execute test cases
Developer: Fix bugs
QA Lead: Approve plan and verify results
Risks and Mitigations
- Heroku API downtime → Retry later
- Rate limiting → Space out test runs
- Token expiry → Regenerate token
Test Scenarios and Sample Test Cases
TC ID	Test Case	Input	Expected Result
TC001	Valid login	admin/password123	200 OK + Token
TC004	Get all booking IDs	No input	200 OK + list
TC008	Create booking with valid payload	JSON body	200 OK + booking ID
TC011	Full update with token (PUT)	Valid token + JSON body	200 OK + updated booking
TC014	Delete booking with token	Token in Cookie header	201 Created
TC017	Ping the server	GET /ping	201 Created
